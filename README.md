# Biometric-Fingerprint-for-School-Attendance-System (MY FYP PROJECT) 
An automated attendance system that uses biometric fingerprint recognition to verify student identity and record attendance instantly.


To run my Biometric Fingerprint School Attendance System, start by downloading and installing Herd from the official website. 
Once installed, open the project in Visual Studio Code. 
Make sure you have MySQL installed and running, then create a new database for the project. Import the provided SQL file (located in the database folder) to set up the necessary tables by executing SOURCE path/to/your/database.sql;, adjusting the path as needed. 
Next, rename the .env.example file in the project folder to .env and configure the database connection settings with your MySQL details. 
Finally, you can run the Laravel project by executing php artisan serve in the terminal and accessing it in your web browser
